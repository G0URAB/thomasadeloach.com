      <div class="content">
        Pastor DeLoach was born in Louisville, Alabama and was later brought to Canton, Ohio by his mother.
        He attended Canton Public Schools, where he was very active. At the age of 13, Pastor DeLoach taught himself how to play the drums. He likewise became quite good in playing two other instruments.
        Grateful for the talents bestowed on him, he vowed to give all the glory and honor back to God – not only through music but in all significant aspects of his life.
